# AP Computer Science A
Collective projects/programs I worked on in AP Computer Science A. Mostly consisting of Java. I worked in the IDE jGRASP. This was a great way to really learn the language. jGRASP doesn't assist you with things like syntax and logical errors, so I was able to fully emerse myself in the language.
